# youtube-crimson
Dark red YouTube theme with included SCSS to change the colours if desired.


# Editing CSS
To compile a new CSS build.bat can be run if NodeJS is installed or if NodeJS is not availiable then you can do a find and replace on the colours defined at the top of .scss/scss.scss


# Applying Theme to YouTube
You can use an extension to load .css/css.css with youtube. I reccomend Enhancer for YouTube, it allows for loading of custom CSS & JS.
